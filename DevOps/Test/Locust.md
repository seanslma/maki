# Locust

Locust is an easy to use, scriptable and scalable (load) **performance** testing tool.

Users behaviour can be defined in regular Python code, instead of being stuck in a UI or restrictive domain specific language.

Locust primarily works with web sites/services, it can be used to test almost any system or protocol.
