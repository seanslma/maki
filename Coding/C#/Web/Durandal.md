# Durandal

Durandal is a JavaScript framework designed to simplify the process of building `single-page applications` (SPAs). 
It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and is intended to work seamlessly with other popular web technologies like Knockout.js, RequireJS, and jQuery.

Durandal was gained popularity in the early 2010s. 
However, it's essential to note that the JavaScript ecosystem has evolved, and other modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have become more prominent in recent years. 
Durandal's usage may have diminished compared to its earlier days. Developers often choose frameworks based on their specific project requirements and preferences.

Key features and components of Durandal include:
- **Composition:** Durandal provides a composition system that facilitates the organization and assembly of
  views, view models, and templates. This helps in creating modular and maintainable SPAs.
- **Router:** Durandal includes a client-side router that enables navigation within the application without requiring full page reloads.
  It supports hash-based URLs and allows for the creation of distinct "routes" within the application.
- **View-Model Binding:** Durandal leverages Knockout.js for data-binding between views and view models.
  This allows for automatic synchronization between the user interface and underlying data.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Durandal helps manage the lifecycle of views and view models.
  It provides hooks for various lifecycle events, allowing developers to execute custom logic during different phases of an SPA's lifecycle.
- **Modular Development:** Durandal encourages modular development by supporting the use of AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) through RequireJS.
  This allows developers to organize their code into manageable modules, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Plugins:** Durandal is extensible and supports the use of plugins to enhance its functionality.
  Developers can create or use existing plugins to add features such as dialogs, widgets, and other reusable components.
- **Convention over Configuration:** Durandal follows the principle of convention over configuration,
  making it easy to set up projects with sensible defaults while still allowing for customization when needed.
