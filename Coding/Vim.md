## Move
Hereâ€™s a handy tip: prefacing a movement command with a number will execute that movement multiple times. So, if you want to move up six lines, enter 6k and Vim will move the cursor up six lines. If you want to move over five words, enter 5w. To move 10 words back, use 10b.

### char
```
<h jv k^ l>
h -> left
l -> right
k -> up
j -> down
```

### word
```
w  -> move forward one word
b  -> move backward one word
de -> move to end of current word
2w -> move to start of 2ed word
3e -> move to end of 3ed word
```

### line
```
0  -> moves to the beginning of the line
^  -> first non empty of the line
$  -> moves to the end of the line
```

### file
```
gg -> move to the beginning of the file
G  -> move to the end of the file
#G -> move to line#
`. -> move to the last edit
^G ->cursor location and file status
```

## change
```
ce  -> delete to word end and insert
c2w -> delete to 3rd word front and insert
c3e
c0
c$
```

## copy and paste
```
v  -> highlight one character at a time
V  -> highlight one line at a time
^v -> highlight by columns
y  -> yank text into the copy buffer (copy)
yw -> copy one word without v
yy -> copy current line without v
p  -> paste text after the current line
P  -> paste text on the current line
```
