# Cross-filtering

- Cross-filtering is used when we want to apply filters from one visual or data point to affect the values or appearance of other visuals or data points in the report. 
- Cross-filtering helps us establish relationships between different visualizations and allows us to analyze and explore data from multiple perspectives simultaneously.

Scenarios to use Power BI cross-filtering:
- Exploring related data: 
  When have multiple visuals in the report that are based on related data, we can use cross-filtering to interactively explore and analyze the data across those visuals. 
  For example, if you have a bar chart showing sales by product category and a line chart showing sales over time, 
  you can use cross-filtering to select a specific product category in the bar chart and see how it impacts the sales trend in the line chart.

- Filtering hierarchies: 
  Cross-filtering is particularly useful when working with hierarchical data. 
  You can use it to filter data at different levels of a hierarchy and see how it affects other visuals. 
  For instance, if you have a tree map displaying sales by country, you can drill down to a specific country, 
  and the other visuals in your report will adjust accordingly to show data related to that country.

- Slicing and dicing data: 
  Cross-filtering enables you to slice and dice your data dynamically. 
  You can choose one or more values in a visual, and those selections will automatically filter the data displayed in other visuals. 
  This interactive filtering capability allows you to analyze different subsets of your data quickly and easily.

- Filtering across pages or report sections: 
  If you have a Power BI report with multiple pages or report sections, you can utilize cross-filtering to maintain the selected filters across those different areas. 
  This ensures consistent filtering and analysis experience as you navigate through the report.
