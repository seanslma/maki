### Moving
h moves the cursor one character to the left.
j moves the cursor down one line.
k moves the cursor up one line.
l moves the cursor one character to the right.
0 moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
$ moves the cursor to the end of the line.
w move forward one word.
b move backward one word.
G move to the end of the file.
gg move to the beginning of the file.
`. move to the last edit.

Hereâ€™s a handy tip: prefacing a movement command with a number will execute that movement multiple times. So, if you want to move up six lines, enter 6k and Vim will move the cursor up six lines. If you want to move over five words, enter 5w. To move 10 words back, use 10b.

### Editing
x delete the current character
d starts the delete operation
dw will delete a word
d0 will delete to the beginning of a line
d$ will delete to the end of a line
dgg will delete to the beginning of the file
dG will delete to the end of the file
u will undo the last operation
Ctrl-r will redo the last undo

### Searching and Replacing
/text search for text in the document, going forward
n move the cursor to the next instance.
N move the cursor to the previous instance
?text search for text in the document, going backwards

:s/a/a_text/ #only replace the first in current line
:s/a/a_text/g #replace all in current line
:8,10 s/a/a_text/g #replace all in line 8 to line 10
:%s/a/a_text/g #entire file
:%s/a/a_text/gc #entire file and confirm before replacing
replace with foo (y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y)? #q-quit, l-stop, ^e-scroll up, ^y down

### Copying and Pasting
    v highlight one character at a time
    V highlight one line at a time
    Ctrl-v highlight by columns
    p paste text after the current line
    P paste text on the current line
    y yank text into the copy buffer
