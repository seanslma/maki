# dcc.Store and dcc.Cache

## when to use Store and when to use Cache
**dcc.Store** is a client-side component that can be used to store data in the browser. 
It is useful for storing data that needs to be shared between multiple callbacks, 
or for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly without making a request to the server.

**Cache** is a server-side mechanism for storing data that can be shared between multiple users and processes. 
It is useful for storing data that is expensive to compute or that needs to be accessed frequently.

Here are some general guidelines for when to use dcc.Store and when to use cache:

* **Use dcc.Store when:**
    * You need to store data that needs to be shared between multiple callbacks.
    * You need to store data that needs to be accessed quickly without making a request to the server.
    * You are storing data that is specific to a single user.

* **Use cache when:**
    * You need to store data that is expensive to compute or that needs to be accessed frequently.
    * You need to store data that needs to be shared between multiple users and processes.
    * You need to store data that persists across browser sessions.

Here are some specific examples:

* **Use dcc.Store to:**
    * Store the results of a data processing operation that is performed in a callback.
    * Store the state of a UI component that needs to be synchronized between multiple callbacks.
    * Store the user's preferences.

* **Use cache to:**
    * Store the results of a database query that is performed frequently.
    * Store the results of a machine learning model that is used to generate predictions.
    * Store the results of a data processing operation that is performed on a large dataset.

It is important to note that dcc.Store and cache are not mutually exclusive. 
You can use both of them in the same app, depending on your specific needs.

For example, you could use dcc.Store to store the results of a data processing operation that is performed in a callback, 
and then use cache to store the results of the same data processing operation for all users. 
This would allow you to avoid performing the data processing operation multiple times for different users.

Another example is to use dcc.Store to store the state of a UI component that needs to be synchronized between multiple callbacks, 
and then use cache to store the state of the UI component for all users. 
This would allow you to avoid sending the state of the UI component back and forth to the server multiple times.

Ultimately, the best way to decide whether to use dcc.Store or cache is to consider your specific needs and requirements.
