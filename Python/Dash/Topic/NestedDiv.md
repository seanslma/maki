# Nested Div

## example
what's the point to add multiple layers of html.Div in this code 
```
html.Div(
  html.Div(
    [  ],
    className="info-tab-content",
    style={'display': 'flex', 'flexDirection': 'column', 'padding': '7px'}
  ),
  className="info-tab-content-wrapper"
)
```

There are a few reasons why you might want to add multiple layers of HTML `Div` elements in this code:
- **To create a more complex layout.** By nesting `Div` elements, you can create a layout with multiple columns, rows, or other sections. This can be useful for creating complex designs like navigation bars, menus, and product galleries.
- **To isolate CSS styles.** By placing different elements in different `Div` elements, you can isolate CSS styles to specific parts of your layout. This can make it easier to maintain and update your CSS code.
- **To improve accessibility.** By using `Div` elements to group related content, you can make it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand your page layout.

In the specific code example you provided, the outer `Div` element has a class of `info-tab-content-wrapper` and the inner `Div` element has a class of `info-tab-content`. This suggests that the outer `Div` element is being used to wrap the entire content area of an information tab, while the inner `Div` element is being used to group the individual elements of the tab content.

By nesting the inner `Div` element within the outer `Div` element, the developer is able to isolate the CSS styles for the tab content from the rest of the page layout. This makes it easier to maintain and update the CSS code for the tab content, and it also makes the code more accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Here is an example of how the CSS code for the tab content could be isolated using the two `Div` elements:

```css
.info-tab-content-wrapper {
  /* CSS styles for the outer wrapper element */
}

.info-tab-content {
  /* CSS styles for the inner content element */
}
```

By isolating the CSS styles for the tab content, the developer can easily change the appearance of the tab content without affecting the rest of the page layout. This can be useful for creating different themes or styles for the page.

Overall, there are many benefits to adding multiple layers of HTML `Div` elements to your code. By nesting `Div` elements, you can create more complex layouts, isolate CSS styles, and improve accessibility.
