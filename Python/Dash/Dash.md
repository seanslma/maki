# Dash

https://realpython.com/python-dash/

Dash is a framework built on top of Flask and React.js, specifically designed for building interactive web applications with complex user interfaces. 
It's particularly useful when you need to create **interactive** `dashboards` or `data visualization` applications.

## Flask
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is well-suited for building web applications of various complexities. 
It's commonly used for building `RESTful APIs` and `web applications`.

## When to use which
- Use Flask alone for a simpler web application with basic functionality and routing needs. 
- Use Dash and Falsk if app requires more complex interactivity, real-time updates, or data visualization features
- We can even integrate Dash components into a Flask application if need to combine the simplicity of Flask with the interactive features of Dash
