# Issue

## jupyterlab cells disapperaed
https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/17023
- changing the "Windowing mode" setting from the default "full" to either "defer" or "none" seems to make the problem go away
- Settings -> Advanced Settings Editor -> Notebook -> Windowing Mode setting
- "defer" not good - there is no way to see some disappeared cells
