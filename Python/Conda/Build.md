# Build 

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/concepts/recipe.html

Building a conda package requires a recipe. A conda-build recipe is a flat directory that contains the following files:
- meta.yaml: Only package/name and package/version are required
- build.sh: It is executed using the bash command for macOS and Linux.
- bld.bat: It is executed using cmd for Windows.
- run_test.[py,pl,sh,bat]: a test script that runs automatically if it is part of the recipe.
- Optional patches that are applied to the source.
- Other resources that are not included in the source and cannot be generated by the build scripts.

## install `conda-build`
```
conda install conda-build
conda update conda-build
```
