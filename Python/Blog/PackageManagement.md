# How to manage python packages
The package management is actually one of the most challenging part of Python programming.

## pin package version
due to bugs or siginificant changes in new versions

## one pinned version might block many packages to be updated

## worse - there are depedency conflicts

## solution
- temporally pin a package version till the system is broken
- find a workaround for the bug so we can still use the new version
