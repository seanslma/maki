# Cross Validation
The number of data for traing should be between 70-80% of the total historical data. 
If we have less data, perhaps you should use more data (up to 90%) for training.

## sliding window 
The total training and test data points are the same but move to the future.

## expanding window
The training window expands while the test window slides.
