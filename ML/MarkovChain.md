# Markov Chain

## how it works
- disrectize values into different buckets (states)
- get the probability from one state to another using historical data
- do the forecast using the matrix

## when to use it
- unpredictable things like wind speed (not good for solar)
- depedent on current state
- good for long term, not good for short term
