## Cyclical learning rate
https://github.com/brianmanderson/Cyclical_Learning_Rate
- vary the learning rate between a lower bound (min_lr) and an upper bound (max_lr) instead of using a fixed or monotonically decaying learning rate. - this can help improve training performance and speed up convergence by allowing the model to explore different areas of the loss landscape.
