# MapReduce
Hadoop MapReduce is a framework to perform computation tasks in parallel across many nodes in a computer cluster.

## shortcomings 
That make Hadoop relatively ill-suited for use cases of an iterative or low-latency nature
- high overheads to launch each job
- reliance on storing intermediate data and results of the computation to disk
