# ARIMA

## ARIMAX (autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables) 
- The ARIMAX model is an extension of the standard ARIMA model, and 
- it allows for the inclusion of one or more exogenous variables in the model equation. 
- The ARIMAX model can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, and 
- the parameters of the model can be estimated using numerical optimization techniques.
