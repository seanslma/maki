# LSTM

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) 
- are both types of recurrent neural network (RNN) layers designed to handle sequential data
- gating mechanisms that allow them to capture long-term dependencies more effectively

## LSTM vs GRU

LSTM: 
- LSTM has more parameters,
- which can result in slightly slower training times compared to GRU,
- especially on larger datasets.
GRU:
- With fewer parameters,
- GRU may have faster training times,
- making it more efficient for larger datasets.
