# Metric

- (MAE) mean absolute error 
- (RMSE) root mean squared error 
- (MAPE) mean absolute percentage error: not good when value is close to zero
- (MAAPE) mean arctangent absolute percentage error : not consistent with the other metrics, why???

For a combination of parameters, if a metric has different patterns compared to the other metrics, it's not consistent and should not be used.
For example, all other metrics show a min for a specific combination of parameters but that metric does not show a min.
