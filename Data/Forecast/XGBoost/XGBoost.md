## how to works
[XGBoost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost-HowItWorks.html

XGBoost: forecast the residuals on different levels and add the forecasts together.

Builds a sequence of weak decision trees (models with low individual accuracy) that progressively improve on the predictions of previous trees. 
Each tree focuses on correcting the errors made by its predecessors.
