Kafka focuses on reliable data `ingestion` and `distribution`, ensuring data is always available for downstream processing.
- distributed, horizontally-scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant commit log
- publish-subscribe messaging system
- streaming data platform
- can store data as long as necessary
