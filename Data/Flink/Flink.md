# Flink

## Flink vs Spark
**Flink**: 
- Stream-first with batch processing capabilities as an extension.
- Designed for real-time processing of continuous data streams with low latency.
- Used in Fraud detection in real-time transactions, IoT data stream processing, real-time anomaly detection, event-driven applications.

**Spark**: 
- Batch-first with micro-batching for streaming.
- Optimized for large-scale batch processing but can handle near real-time streaming through micro-batching intervals.
- Used in Large-scale data analysis, machine learning model training, graph processing, interactive data exploration, batch ETL pipelines.
