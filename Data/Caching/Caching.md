# Caching

## Cache eviction
Cache eviction is the process of removing older or less frequently used data.
- Least-recently used (LRU) eviction: evict data that hasn't been accessed for the longest period of time
- Least-frequently used (LFU) eviction: evict data that has been accessed the fewest number of times
- Time-to-live (TTL) eviction: evict data after a given period of time
- First-in-first-out (FIFO) eviction: not common
