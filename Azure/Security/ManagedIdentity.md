- Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. 
- Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.
- The key difference between Azure managed identities and service principals is that, with the former, admins do not have to manage credentials, including passwords.
