# Bastion
Azure Bastion uses your browser to connect to VMs in your virtual network over 
- secure shell (SSH) or
- remote desktop protocol (RDP) by using their private IP addresses.
The VMs don't need public IP addresses, client software, or special configuration.

Azure Bastion is a fully managed service that provides 
- more secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and 
- Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) access to virtual machines (VMs) without any exposure through public IP addresses
