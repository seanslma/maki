# Subnet

- Subnets provide isolation within a virtual network
- Subnet IP range should not be too large or too small

## Filter network traffic between subnets
- `Network security groups` and `application security groups` can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules.
- These rules enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination `IP address`, `port`, and `protocol`. 
- A `network virtual appliance` is a VM that performs a network function, such as a firewall, WAN optimization, or other network function.
