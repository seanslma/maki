# IoT

## stages
- Connectivity: connection being made between a device and the IoT service
- Identity: identification of the device and allowing to send device telemetry using an authentication process
- Capture: device telemetry is captured and received by the IoT service
- Ingestion: IoT service ingests the device telemetry
- Storage: device telemetry is stored
- Transformation: telemetry data is transformed for further processing
- Analytics: find patterns, anomalies, and insights from transformed data
- Presentation: insights are shown as dashboards and reports
