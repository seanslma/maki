# ##vso[task.setvariable variable=release;isReadOnly=true]$release

The Azure Pipelines command `echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=release;isReadOnly=true]$release"` is used to set a pipeline variable in a specific way. 

### Syntax and Components

1. **`##vso[task.setvariable]`**:
   - This is an Azure Pipelines logging command used to set or update variables during a pipeline run. It communicates directly with the Azure DevOps agent to change variable values.

2. **`variable=release`**:
   - This specifies the name of the variable you want to set or update. In this case, the variable name is `release`.

3. **`isReadOnly=true`**:
   - This option marks the variable as read-only. Once a variable is set with `isReadOnly=true`, it cannot be changed by subsequent steps in the pipeline. This is useful to ensure that critical variables remain constant once they've been set.

4. **`$release`**:
   - This represents the value to assign to the `release` variable. The `$release` notation implies that the value is taken from a previously defined variable or expression.

### Example Scenario
- **Purpose**: You want to set a pipeline variable named `release` to a certain value and ensure that this variable is immutable (read-only) for the remainder of the pipeline execution.
- **Value**: The value assigned to the `release` variable is derived from another variable or is dynamically generated during the pipeline execution.

### How It Works
1. **Execution**: During a pipeline run, the command `echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=release;isReadOnly=true]$release"` is executed by the Azure Pipelines agent.
2. **Setting Variable**: The `task.setvariable` command sets the value of the `release` variable to the value specified by `$release`.
3. **Read-Only**: By specifying `isReadOnly=true`, the `release` variable is locked, preventing any further changes to it.

### Example Usage in a Pipeline
```yaml
jobs:
- job: SetVariable
  steps:
  - script: |
      # Define a value for the variable
      release_value="v1.2.3"

      # Set the variable 'release' and make it read-only
      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=release;isReadOnly=true]$release_value"
    displayName: 'Set release variable'

  - script: |
      # Use the read-only variable
      echo "The release version is $(release)"
    displayName: 'Display release variable'
```

### Key Points
- **Persistence**: The variable `release` will be available to subsequent steps in the pipeline, but it cannot be modified after it's set as read-only.
- **Scope**: The variable `release` will only be available in the pipeline run in which it was set and won't persist across different pipeline runs.

This command is a powerful way to manage and secure variable values within Azure Pipelines, ensuring that critical data remains unchanged throughout the pipeline's execution.
