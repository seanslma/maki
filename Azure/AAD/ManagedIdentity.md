# Managed Identity
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview

- Two types: 
  - `System assigned` (1:1):  generated by the service, will be deleted when the parent resource or service is deleted
  - `User assigned` (1:n): created standalone and assigned to services, can be applied and reused with multiple services
- Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication.
- Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.
- The **key difference** between Azure `managed identities` and `service principals` is that, with the former, admins do not have to manage credentials, including passwords - so no one knows the credentials.

## difference between service principal
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61322079/difference-between-service-principal-and-managed-identities-in-azure

- Managed identities manage the creation and automatic renewal of a service principal on your behalf?
- Managed identities are service principals of a special type, which are locked to only be used with Azure resources.
- When the managed identity is deleted, the corresponding service principal is automatically removed.
- When a User-Assigned or System-Assigned Identity is created, the Managed Identity Resource Provider (MSRP) issues a certificate internally to that identity.
