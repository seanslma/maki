* copy cols to col (x is the matrix name, G1 is the first cell in destination)
  =OFFSET(x, MOD(ROW()-ROW($G$1),ROWS(x)), TRUNC((ROW()-ROW($G$1))/ROWS(x)), 1, 1)
  
* copy rows to col (x is the matrix name, G1 is the first cell in destination)
  =OFFSET(x, TRUNC((ROW()-ROW($G$1))/COLUMNS(x)), MOD(ROW()-ROW($G$1),COLUMNS(x)), 1, 1)
  
* text to date
  =value("2019-02-02 12:55:00")
  
```excel
MAX(INDIRECT("A"&B1&":A"&B2))

```

### Add-In error
Error: Object variable or With block variable not set

Since the add-in was registered with excel, the following line succeeded:\\
**Set addin = Application.COMAddIns("My AddIn")**\\
But since it was disabled, the object was not created and\\
**Set automationObject = addin.Object**
resulted in Nothing

Solution: File -> Options -> Add-Ins -> Select the type of that Add-In and click 'Go' -> Enabled it

### Unhide cols
When hide and unhide do not work, it is possible that the panel is freezed.

=AVERAGE(OFFSET($C$1,E2-1,0,E3-E2,1))

### force vba rebuid
Reg.exe add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\Options" /v "ForceVBALoadFromSource" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
Reg.exe add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VBA\7.1\Common" /v "CompileOnDemand" /t REG_DWORD /d "0" /f

### excel locked for editing
first delete the hidden ownership file, in the same folder, using a dos command 'dir' and 'del'

then perhaps need to check which user locks the file using cmd mmc (Microsoft Management Console) by adding opened files (need server admin permission).

### check if a cell is referenced or not
  Formulas > Trace Dependents
  Formulas > Remove Arrows > Remove Dependent Arrows
  
### Find links (external references) in a workbook
  'does not work for formula in conditional format,
  Find and Replace -> Options 
  -> [Find what]=.xl, [Within box]=Workbook,[Look in]=Formulas 
  -> Find All
  'use findlink.xlam instead: https://www.manville.org.uk/software/findlink.htm
  -> Data -> BMA Group -> Find Links

### ArrayFormula does not work when including INDIRECT function
why? do not need to input the brackets but use Shift + Ctrl + Enter

### index match skip empty value
{=INDEX(A:A,MATCH(1,(B:B=C1)*(A:A<>""),0))}
