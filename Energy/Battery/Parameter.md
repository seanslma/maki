## lifetime throughput
Battery `lifetime throughput` refers to the total amount of energy a battery can store and release over its entire lifespan. 
It's a key metric for understanding a battery's durability and total capacity for work. 
- **Throughputs vs. Cycle Life**
  Traditionally, battery life is measured in cycles (charges and discharges).
  Throughput goes beyond cycles and considers the total energy a battery can deliver,
  accounting for factors like efficiency losses during charging and discharging.
- **Impact on Battery Choice**
  Throughput helps compare batteries for different applications.
  A higher throughput for the same capacity indicates a longer-lasting battery,
  making it ideal for scenarios needing frequent charging and discharging, like solar energy storage. 
- **Units and Calculations**
  Throughput is typically measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or megawatt-hours (MWh).
  While the exact calculation can vary, it factors in the battery's initial capacity,
  degradation over time, and efficiency during charging/discharging cycles.
