## SWAP
A swap is a financial derivative contract between two parties who agree to exchange cash flows or other financial instruments over a specified period. 

In electricity markets, swaps are often used to manage price risk associated with fluctuations in electricity prices.

Electricity swaps allow market participants, such as generators, retailers, and other stakeholders, to hedge against the volatility of electricity prices. 
For example, a generator may enter into a swap agreement to fix the price at which they sell electricity, providing predictability in revenue.

## CAP
A cap is a financial instrument that sets a maximum limit on the price of a commodity, such as electricity, within a specified period. 

It provides protection against price spikes beyond a predetermined level.

In electricity markets, participants can purchase price caps as a risk management strategy (pay premium in all intervals). 
If the market price exceeds the cap, the cap holder receives compensation for the difference. 

Caps are often used by electricity consumers or retailers to limit their exposure to extremely high prices during periods of peak demand or supply shortages.
