# MLF (Marginal Loss factors)

**Marginal network losses** are always a more appropriate basis for computing loss factors than **average network losses** from the point of view of market design, because they reflect the underlying ideal relationship between locational marginal prices better (remembering that a key principle of the NEM is the adoption of marginal pricing).

## Issues
### how the settlement is allocated?
generators are paid by the electricity they provide and customers pay the amount they use. so there are some residues in the settlement. The residues are currently allocated to customers.

### why it becomes important recently?
More projects are connected to the network with a unpredictable speed, leading to quick change of the mlf in the system.

Transparency of the potential projects will help other investors to decide where to develop their projects for a more efficient system.
