## market

By 2040, an estimated 15 GW of synchronous capacity will exit the market, while 30-40 GW of non-synchronous generation will enter over that time.
- **frequency control**: keep frequency operating within the right limits
- **system strength**: like a major generator or user disconnecting from the system

system services were historically provided as a by-product of generating from coal, gas and hydro sources. But as thermal generators are retired, they not only no longer provide these additional services, but there is also an absence of signals to incentivise other parties to provide these services in the NEM.

## system strength
It is an umbrella term that refers to a number of different issues. A strong, stable voltage means this voltage sine wave is very smooth in shape, doesn’t deform too much when there is a disturbance on the system, and typically doesn’t get too big or too small. We say the system is strong if the **voltage wave form meets these conditions**; it exhibits high system strength.
