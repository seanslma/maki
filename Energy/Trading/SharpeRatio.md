# sharpe ratio
The **Sharpe ratio** is a measure of **risk-adjusted return** used to evaluate the performance of an investment, portfolio, or strategy. It shows whether an investment's returns are due to smart investment decisions or just excessive risk.

## Calculation and Formula
The Sharpe ratio is calculated by taking the excess return of the investment over a risk-free rate and dividing it by the standard deviation of those returns.

$$\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$$

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{R_p}$ | The **average return** of the investment or portfolio. |
| $\mathbf{R_f}$ | The **risk-free rate of return** (e.g., the yield of a short-term U.S. Treasury Bill). |
| $\mathbf{R_p - R_f}$ | The **excess return** of the investment (the premium for taking risk). |
| $\mathbf{\sigma_p}$ | The **standard deviation** of the portfolio's excess return (a measure of its volatility/risk). |

## Interpretation
In general, a **higher Sharpe ratio is better**. It indicates that the investment is generating more return for each unit of risk (volatility) taken.

* **Sharpe Ratio > 1.0:** Considered acceptable or good.
* **Sharpe Ratio > 2.0:** Considered very good (often described as excellent).
* **Sharpe Ratio > 3.0:** Considered exceptional.

**Key takeaway**:

The ratio is a powerful tool because it penalizes performance that is achieved simply by taking on more risk. If two portfolios have the same return, the one with the **lower volatility** (and thus higher Sharpe ratio) is the better investment.

## History
The Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate **William F. Sharpe** in 1966, originally published as the "reward-to-variability ratio." It is one of the most fundamental metrics in modern portfolio theory (MPT).
