## firm vs non-firm load
The non firm load is just the flexibility part of the contract? So the target volume is the expected total demand.

Firm Load:
- A "firm load" refers to electricity demand that is considered essential and reliable.
  It represents a customer's guaranteed and consistent electricity consumption.
  Customers with firm loads typically have a high level of reliability and dependability in their electricity supply.
- In the context of electricity supply contracts, when a customer has a firm load,
  it means that the utility or supplier commits to providing a specified quantity of electricity on a continuous and uninterrupted basis.
  The customer can rely on the electricity being available whenever needed.
- Customers with firm loads often pay a premium for this level of reliability and
  may enter into long-term contracts or agreements to ensure a stable and uninterrupted power supply.

Non-firm Load:
- A "non-firm load" represents electricity demand that is subject to interruption or curtailment by the electricity supplier or grid operator.
  It is typically considered non-guaranteed or interruptible load.
- In the context of electricity supply contracts, non-firm load customers may have lower priority in terms of electricity supply during times of high demand or emergencies.
  The supplier can curtail or interrupt the supply to these customers if necessary to maintain the overall stability of the grid.
- Non-firm load customers often pay lower rates for their electricity because they accept the risk of occasional interruptions in their service.
  These customers may include industrial users who can temporarily reduce their electricity consumption during peak periods.
