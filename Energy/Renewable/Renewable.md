**PEC**: Partial Exemption Certificate\\
A certificate that provides partial exemption for prescribed Emissions Intensive Trade Exposed activities from Large-Scale Renewable Energy Target and the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme liabilities. Eligible Emissions Intensive Trade Exposed activities must apply to the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator annually for Partial Exemption Certificates. These Partial Exemption Certificates can be on-sold to Large-Scale Renewable Energy Target and the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme liable entities.

**Operational demand** is the demand that must be met by centrally dispatched generation. In other words, it is the total electrical consumption from grid-connected consumers less production from rooftop solar.

**Residual demand** is the operational demand minus large-scale renewable production at each 5-minute period.

## Solar

### solar-battery
revenues:
- arbitrage - energy trading
- FCAS markets

issues:
- paired with the solar farm, which has a large low voltage tariff class, attracts heavy “demand tariffs” from the local network operator
- being paired with a solar farm and having to operate under the constraints of that facility’s connection agreement: This effectively means that the combined solar farm and battery are limited to the 50MW rating, meaning the battery is effectively constrained to using headroom in this connection point from un-utilised solar output [better using self-forecasting to improve accuracy].

## Battery
Batteries can be more rapidly deployed than traditional firming capacity that is used to augment renewables when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing and are perhaps more flexible in terms of location.

Locational marginal prices (LMPs), as would be provided under transmission access reform in the NEM, will provide batteries with more granular information in relation to:
- concentrations of generation, in particular intermittent generation;
- concentrations of load;
- constraints on the transmission network; and
- volatile prices at specific points on the network as a consequence of the interaction of the first two factors with the third.

### battery markets
The investment and operational case for a battery is derived from several markets. Some of the most notable options are:
- providing system services, such as frequency regulation, voltage support or reactive power support;
- co-located firming of generators such as wind or solar farms;
- transmission and distribution investment deferral by managing the load on the transmission or distribution level below its specified maximum level;
- arbitrage in the wholesale market for energy, where batteries charge using inexpensive electrical energy and discharge when prices for electricity are high. This option allows large-scale batteries to alleviate congestion on the transmission network (just as they would for transmission deferral), but does so through responses to price incentives whether these are regional prices or locational marginal prices.
- peak demand lopping for significant loads; and
- providing virtual cap products for significant loads that would otherwise purchase these products directly or indirectly from the contract market.

### NEM utility scale batteries
In Australia, large-scale battery storage deployment is still in its early stages. There are currently five registered battery storage systems in excess of 1 MW capacity.

These five systems are:
- the Ballarat Energy Storage System in Victoria;
- the Gannawarra Energy Storage System in Victoria;
- the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia;
- the Dalrymple North Battery Energy Storage System in South Australia; and
- the Lake Bonney BESS1 in South Australia.

The drivers behind each of these large-scale batteries vary. The Ballarat Energy Storage System’s construction was motivated in large part by locational considerations, as it was expected to be able to ease constraints on transmission lines in Western Victoria that reduce the output of wind and solar-generated electricity.  It was also commissioned to provide FCAS services.

The Gannawarra Energy Storage System was commissioned in North-Western Victoria to participate in energy price arbitrage and provide FCAS services, though the possibility of using the battery to reduce curtailment of future renewable energy generation on a relatively constrained line has also been noted.

The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery in Mid-Northern South Australia, installed as part of the South Australian Government’s energy policy to accelerate the roll-out of grid-scale energy storage,  has been noted to provide a backup source of electricity, provide FCAS services and participate in price arbitrage using spot market prices. Another rationale for the battery was noted to be the extended support for the Heywood interconnector by alleviating system security constraints.

The Dalrymple North battery on South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula focuses on providing reliability in the case of islanding and FCAS to reduce constraints on the Heywood interconnector and improve system security by quickly injecting electricity into the transmission network following a disturbance.

The Lake Bonney battery in South Australia has been commissioned with the intent of firming nearby renewable generation and providing FCAS services.
