# non-anticipativity

## basic
- https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/educ.1053.0016
- decisions made at a specific point in time cannot rely on information that is only available in the future
- non-anticipativity constraint: scenarios with a common history must (logically) have the same set of decisions
- objective: expected cost is the sum of the weighted cost of each scenario, so the decision is made based on all the scenario posibilities
