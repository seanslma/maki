Treatment of Dispatchable Loads.pdf

Scheduled load will clear the bids **from the highest price band to lowest price band**. This is because the band price represents the maximum market clearing price that the market participant is willing to pay before decreasing the electricity consumption of their scheduled load by up to the MW increment in that band for the specified trading interval. This means if the market price is higher than the band price this band will not be scheduled.
